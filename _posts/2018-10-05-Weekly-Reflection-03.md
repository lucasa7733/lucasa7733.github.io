This week we focused on expressions and functions in Pyret. We styled our webistes with CSS (a way to chang the background, fonts, and colors of the webiste). Then we proceeded to learn about new html tags such as "<head>, <body>, <title>, and <li>, etc. Each of these are used to do different things in an html webpage like (title -> The title of the program. li -> A list inside of the program). These tags are gonna help us form our webistes.
