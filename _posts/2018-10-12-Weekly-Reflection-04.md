This week we had Monday off so I didn't have AP CS until Wednesday first period. In that class period we looked at the Pyret (a coding language) 
library to find resources for making our flags. We had to look for images to use for our chosen flag. For my flag I chose Ghana, it was a bit challenging but, I can't wait to show you the final result. At this point we're still working on our websites so every class period is basically the same thing. Expect more detailed log posts in the near future.
