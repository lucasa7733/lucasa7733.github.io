In this week of CS we first were identifying changes in video games. Such as in run, where your character is moving left and right dodging obstecles. This was easy to identify but, hard to word. I feel like we as people have a hard time describing the changes of our life and rather not question what is different.

Next we studied graphs and learned how to describe where an object is on a coordinate plane. We learned that in CS the origin is usually on the top left. I was late to that class period so I didn't really know what was happeneing but, eventually I caught up. I think we learned this so we can eventually make our own programs using this information.

Then finally on Friday, we took a quiz on what we've learned so far this week and were able to partake in a class discussion. This discussion was based on a program that we reacted to and then posted our wonders and observations to Google Classroom. I am still very excited for this course and so far am pleased for feeling like I'm actually learning in an advanced course.
