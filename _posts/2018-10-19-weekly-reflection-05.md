# Monday

In class we practiced coding "overlays" which helped us in our flag project. We were required to solve coding issues
involving the positioning of ellipses and rectangles. So far creating images in pyret seems to be almost muscle memory to me due to my prior knowledge of CS.


# Wednesday

In class the whole period we were able to work on our flags and figure out how to translate what we learned Monday into making our final flags. Strengthening our ability to make connections between code.

# Friday 

Today in class our teacher taught us a new code called "monospace". He said he'd go more in depth about it on Monday because he wanted us to spend the whole period working on our websites. I really enjoy these days of class because it's just non stop coding.

# Some Examples Of Code In My Flag

#combination of simple parts for ghana

YR-RR= place-image(YR, 300 - 150, 200 - 100, RR)

GR-RR= place-image(GR, 300 - 150, 200 - 33.3, YR-RR)

BS-GR-RR= place-image(BS, 150, 150 - 50, GR-RR)

Basically what this code does is tells the computer to put the shapes (YR, RR, = Yellow Rectangle and Red Rectangle, etc.) 
in the right placements to produce the actual flag image.
