AP Computer Science, when I think of the potential I have with learning in this class I get excited for the future. This school has made it abundantly clear that courses like these are rare for High Schoolers to take and I am very grateful for the oppurtunities I will be presented with during my four years at AFSE. So far I am very pleased with this course. I feel as though my love and respect for Computer Science has evolved. I can't wait to see the end result of my blog and how I will be able to utilize it for my future.  - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
