# Showing Vulnerability in Learning

From now on I'm going to try and stray away from the structured reflections I've made before and go into a more generalized way
of describing my time in AP CS.
This week the one day that stood out the most for this course was Thursday the 6th of Decemeber.
Due to most of the class being absent on the trip, the teacher thought it'd be a nice time to have
a conversation on where the course is going. He kept his ideas blunt yet silenced, he let us go on 
and on about what we thought he could do differently as a teacher and what has been challenging us.
Although most of the class fooled around and treated the period as if it were a free one, I genuinely
listened to what the teacher thought about our ideas
