# My Understanding Of The Past Few Classes

On Monday in class our teacher introduced us to Data Science. Data science is a popular part of computer science that uses knowledge of logistics and algorithims to store and pull out information. At this point our teacher has been jumping back and forth from lessons but, I see what the teacher is trying to do. As a teacher it must be hard to create lessons that are easy for the students to take in especially in such a hard course. I do respect the teach though for attempting to maje every lesson relate to one another.
